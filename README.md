1.Which tools and model(s) you used?

AWS Elastic Beanstalk Hugging Face's Transformers

2.what approaches worked well (and what didn't)

Not much worked or experimented here, for AWS Elastic Beanstalk we were only able to set up the environment but after I upload our file the website just stuck at "Elastic Beanstalk is launching your environment. This will take a few minutes." and we couldn't proceed any further.

3.areas the tools struggled with and excelled at

I guess if the environment is successfully launched then deploy and manage web applications should be next thing to be experiment. We found that it supports Python applications, including Flask, and provides built-in scalability and monitoring features. The struggle for this tool is most likely the error handling because we don't know how and what cause the problem, the website just stuck there at launching.

4.comparison of the code generation abilities of general assistants vs. coding-specific tool

General Assistants (ChatGPT):

Strengths:

Natural language understanding: General assistants can interpret and generate human-like text responses based on natural language prompts.

Versatility: They can assist with a wide range of tasks beyond coding, including writing, brainstorming, and providing general information.

Contextual understanding: They can maintain context over multiple interactions and provide responses tailored to specific queries.

Limitations:

Lack of domain-specific knowledge: While general assistants can provide general guidance on coding-related tasks, they may not have in-depth knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, or best practices.

Limited code understanding: They may struggle with complex coding tasks that require deep understanding of programming concepts and logic.

Coding-Specific Tools (Elastic Beanstalk):

Strengths:

Domain-specific knowledge: Coding-specific tools are designed specifically for software development and deployment tasks, providing features tailored to the needs of developers.

Automated deployment: They offer streamlined workflows for deploying and managing applications, reducing the manual effort required.

Integration with development tools: They often integrate with version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and other development tools to provide a seamless development experience.

Limitations:

Lack of natural language interface: Unlike general assistants, coding-specific tools typically rely on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or command-line interfaces (CLIs) rather than natural language interactions.

Limited scope: While coding-specific tools excel at tasks related to software development and deployment, they may not be as versatile as general assistants for non-coding tasks.

5.recommendations for fellow students/developers on how to get the most out of the tools

Be sure to do enough research on how the tools is to be used online, gather enough information on how to use it. These kinds of tools should be very useful if it function properly.

6.How have your thoughts on "programming as theory" changed?

At first, we thought programming was just about writing code to make things work. But after reading "Programming as Theory," we realized it's more like creating a blueprint or a set of instructions, kind of like a theory about how things should work. So, my thoughts on "programming as theory" changed from just writing code to understanding the deeper principles and ideas behind it.

7.Does programming require this deeper connection between the real world and the program code?

We think programming does require a deeper connection between the real world and the code. It's not just about typing lines of code; it's about understanding real-world problems and translating them into instructions that a computer can understand. So, having that connection helps programmers write better, more effective code.

8.Do you feel the same about the most important skills for programmers to have?

We still think the most important skills for programmers are problem-solving and logical thinking. Being able to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and then figuring out how to solve them step by step is super important. Also, being able to think logically and understand how different parts of a program fit together is key.

9.How do you envision the future of coding?

The future of coding should be more interesting! We think we'll see more automation and AI helping programmers write code faster and more efficiently. But at the same time, we think the human element will always be important. Creativity and critical thinking will still play a big role in solving complex problems and coming up with innovative solutions. So, we see coding becoming more collaborative and interdisciplinary, with people from different backgrounds working together to create amazing things.
